Revision history for Perl extension fp.

0.03 Wed Sept 28 2005
    - added implementation of lambda calculus using
      perl subs as the lambda abstraction

0.02 Fri July 9 2004
    - I added fp::functionals to this module. This
      too has been kicking around for a little while
      and I initially did not include it since it uses
      assigment, and I wanted this pure. But pure-shmure,
      functionals (or higher-order functions) are 
      part of functional programming too.

0.01 Wed May 26, 2004
    - This module has been kicking around for a 
      while now. I have never thought of it as 
      useful, being as esoteric as it is, but I 
      figured I would release it anyway.
